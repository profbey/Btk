whats the modules?

when doing a programming, there can be many complex.
we should divide the program to easyly control the program and to update afterly.
so, we use the modules structure.

modules then communicate with each other.

for example, module A can exchange and trigger with module b and module c as helpers.
main.py is the structure that performs all the main triggers and operations.
even if other modules perform operations with each other, they are eventually run in the main.py file as the main file.
this is necessary both to keep track of how the program is working and for optimization.

So instead of using a definition process or any other structure in the main file, we will only use the triggers of these modules.

types of modules:

1- you can prepare a module
2- Existing modules
        A) Standart Library Modules
        B) Third part Modules   (pypi.org)
                > pip install package-name
